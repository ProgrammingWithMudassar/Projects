PNG, and WebP. JPEG is best for photographs or detailed images with lots of colors. PNG

Uploading images with larger dimensions than needed can unnecessarily increase the file
size.`} style="mt-4" />

can help you compress your images without losing quality. Some popular ones include
Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, and online services like TinyPNG or CompressJPEG.
`} style="mt-4" />
                <List title={`Implement Lazy Loading: `} text={`Lazy loading is a technique where images only load when they
come into the viewer's viewport. This can significantly improve page load time, especially
for pages with lots of images.`} style="mt-4" />
                <List title={`Use a CDN (Content Delivery Network): `} text={`A CDN can help deliver your images faster to
users around the world by storing copies of your images in multiple geographical locations.`} style="mt-4" />
